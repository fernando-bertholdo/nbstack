# Contributing & maintaining

This marketplace is maintained for personal and project-specific use, so external contributions
aren't actively solicited — but issues and discussion are welcome on the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/fernando-bertholdo/nbstack/issues).

This document is for **maintainers and the curious**: how the repo is laid out, how plugins get
here, and where the deeper conventions live. For day-to-day maintenance conventions — the
`+upstream-X.Y.Z` versioning scheme, local-patch sentinels, and the anti-drift checklist — see
[`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md).

Each plugin is fully self-contained under `plugins/<name>/` with its own manifest, docs, license,
and changelog.

## Two kinds of plugin

| Kind | Examples | Source of skill content |
|---|---|---|
| **Native** | `ui-excellence`, `smart-session-rename-cc` | Authored and maintained directly in this repo under `plugins/<name>/skills/`. |
| **Vendored** | `prompt-master`, `generate-session-prompt` | Mirrored from an upstream repo into `plugins/<name>/upstream/`, refreshed weekly by a sync workflow. Don't hand-edit `upstream/` casually — any change there is a *local patch* and must follow the sentinel rules in [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md). |

## Promoting a skill from `tech-product-template`

Skills are developed in the private `tech-product-template` repo (**Tier 1**, source of truth) and
promoted to this marketplace (**Tier 2**, distribution) via sparse-checkout / `git subtree` sync.
Movement is always Tier 1 → Tier 2, never the reverse.

The full workflow — architecture model, one-time fine-grained-PAT setup, the
`scripts/promote-skill.sh` bootstrap, and troubleshooting — lives in
[`docs/promotion-runbook.md`](./docs/promotion-runbook.md).

Weekly automated sync runs from [`.github/workflows/`](./.github/workflows/) (Mondays 09:00 UTC, 06:00 BRT),
opening a PR when an upstream advances and an auto-deduplicated `[sync-failure] <skill>` issue if a
run fails. **Merge sync PRs with `--merge`, never `--squash`** — squash collapses the
`chore(...): sync from ...` commits that document which upstream snapshot is embedded in which of
our commits.

## Conventions

Before adding, renaming, or version-bumping a plugin, read the **anti-drift checklist** in
[`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md) — it lists every touchpoint (the two manifests, the README, both
changelogs) that must stay in sync, plus a quick consistency check to run before committing.
