## What This Plugin Does

`ui-excellence` bundles opinionated, production-ready skills for web interface work. Each skill is framework-agnostic and focuses on decisions, trade-offs, and concrete checklists rather than boilerplate code.

The plugin is designed for two modes of use:

1. **On-demand invocation** — call individual skills when you need targeted guidance (`/ui-excellence:animation-motion` for motion decisions, `/ui-excellence:heuristics` for usability audits, etc.).
2. **Path-aware auto-loading** *(coming in a later release)* — a coordinator skill will auto-load when editing UI files (`*.tsx`, `*.vue`, `*.svelte`, `*.css`, `*.scss`, `*.html`) and route to the right specialist based on signals in your prompt.

| `foundations/accessibility` | `/ui-excellence:accessibility` | Full WCAG 2.1 AA implementation: keyboard nav, semantic HTML, ARIA, color contrast, screen readers. |

### Systems (adapted from [wondelai/skills](https://github.com/wondelai/skills))

## Installing

### Through the marketplace (recommended)

```
/plugin marketplace add fernando-bertholdo/nbstack
/plugin install ui-excellence@nbstack
/reload-plugins
```

### Via a local clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fernando-bertholdo/nbstack.git
cd nbstack
```

Then in Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add ./
/plugin install ui-excellence@nbstack
/reload-plugins
```

### Directly via `--plugin-dir`

```bash
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/nbstack/plugins/ui-excellence
```

See the [marketplace-level README](../../README.md#installing-plugins) for the full installation guide including `settings.json` auto-install.

## Coordinator

The `_coordinator` skill (`/ui-excellence:coordinator`) is a triage router that analyzes task context and loads the right specialist skill(s) automatically. It includes:

- Decision tree covering 12 task patterns (from "build a modal" to "engagement audit")
- Signal-based routing with specific file/prompt triggers for each skill
- 16-entry Multi-Routing table for common multi-skill combinations
- 9-layer priority order for applying multiple skills simultaneously
- `paths:` frontmatter for auto-loading when editing UI files (`*.tsx`, `*.vue`, `*.css`, etc.)

**Note:** `paths:` auto-loading in plugin skills is aspirational — empirical validation pending. The coordinator can always be invoked directly via `/ui-excellence:coordinator`.

## Feature Completeness

The `v1.0.0-alpha.3` release contains all 13 planned skills. The plugin is feature-complete for the `v1.0.0` milestone. Remaining work before `v1.0.0` release is integration and cleanup in the consumer repos (flat replication to `.codex/` and `.agents/`, settings.json configuration, and legacy skill cleanup).

See [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md) for release history.

## Cross-References to External Skills

Some wondelai skills reference other wondelai skills (e.g., "For typeface selection, see web-typography") in their description fields. These are navigational hints from the original catalog, not functional dependencies. Where the referenced skill exists in this plugin, it is accessible via the new namespace (e.g., `/ui-excellence:typography`). Where it does not exist in this plugin (e.g., `top-design`, `contagious`, `drive-motivation`, `storybrand-messaging`, `one-page-marketing`, `design-everyday-things`), the reference is a pointer to the original [wondelai/skills](https://github.com/wondelai/skills) catalog.
